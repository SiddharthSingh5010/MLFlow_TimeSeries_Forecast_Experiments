# Time Series Forecasting with Popular Models

## Description
This repository demonstrates the training and forecasting of time series data using some of the most popular models, including NBEATS, NHITS, AutoARIMA, and LightGBM. It also integrates MLFlow to facilitate running experiments and tracking metrics effectively.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SiddharthSingh5010/MLFlow_TimeSeries_Forecast_Experiments.git
    cd MLFlow_TimeSeries_Forecast_Experiments
    ```
2. Run the following command to start the training and forecasting process. Make sure to replace `<your_uri>` with the URI where your MLFlow UI is running example http:/0.0.0.0:5000:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py --uri <your_uri>
    ```
